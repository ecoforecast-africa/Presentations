### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

> Seeks to *make prediction a central focus in ecology*, on a time scale that is both useful for decision makers and allows us to learn from testing our predictions (i.e. days to decades)

-   Aims to aid environmental decision making.
-   The **"gold standard"** is a reproducible informatics pipeline that can iteratively ingest new data and **make new forecasts automatically** as new data become available with minimal user inpu - allowing ongoing assessment, refinement and improved accuracy.
-   This poses a number of major challenges and requires a big improvement in quantitative skills in biology.
-   Fortunately, any steps towards the gold standard are likely to be useful, even if we never get there.

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting 

Can be represented as a cycle, mirroring the scientific method:

The key steps are:

1.  Make a **forecast** based on initial conditions
2.  **Compare** your forecast to new observations
3.  **Analyse** the observations in the context of your forecast and initial conditions
4.  **Update** estimates of the current state of the system (data and understanding), before making a new forecast

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting 

Iterative ecological forecasts are thus aimed at:

1.  ***applied*** outcomes, through providing evidence to support ***decision making***
2.  ***knowledge generation*** through iterative learning i.e. ***the scientific method***

So it's a great way of getting scientists to engage in real-world problems, demonstrating the value of our science, and ***learning by doing!***

### Iterative ecological forecasting in context 

![](img/dietze2018_F1.jpg){fig-align="center"}

This figure from Dietze et al. 2018 provides an expanded representation of these conceptual links between iterative ecological forecasting, the scientific method, and decision making (here in the context of *adaptive management*, which is a management paradigm that focuses on learning by doing).


## Why an EFI for Africa? {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

Most data products that inform global policy are developed in the Global North, but these are erroneous in places, largely due to lack of local knowledge...

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_app("https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/", 
  height = "400px")
```

Being "stakeholders" is not good enough. We need Africans holding the reigns.

And more than half of GBIF records are from South Africa (38,145,962 records).

Hopefully showing the value of our own data to our decision makers will improve this.

-   Building a community of practice to develop ecoforecasting capacity in Africa

-   Held our first meeting to discuss and plan the way forward a few weeks ago
    - Early days, but we have a lot of interest and enthusiasm
    - Now's a good time to get involved if you'd like to help steer the ship
